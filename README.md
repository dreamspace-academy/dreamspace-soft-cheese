# Soft Cheesemaking in Batticaloa at DreamSpace Bio Lab

This project was done to establish know-how on making soft cheese with easily available ingredients in Batticaloa, Sri Lanka.

Cheese is a fermented dairy product and the practice of making cheese goes back 8000 to 10000 years since the initial domestication of milk-producing animals took place. Cheese is an excellent source of protein, vitamins and calcium. Cheese products have a higher amount of calcium than milk. Apart from having higher calcium content than milk, cheese can be a better source of calcium for many people because is low in lactose compared to  milk. In this project, we explored the process of making cheese with low tech, and low-budget settings. Which could be beneficial for underserved local communities in Sri Lanka.
